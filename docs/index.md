# Workshop for Building Secure APIs in the Cloud

In this workshop, you get hands-on experience applying security best practices to improve the security posture of APIs built on AWS. We examine best practices for security and many of the security features and services available on the AWS platform, including [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/ "Amazon Cognito"), [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/ "AWS WAF"), [Amazon API Gateway input validation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-method-request-validation.html "API GW request valiation"), [API Gateway usage plans](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-api-usage-plans.html "Usage plans"), [API Gateway authentication and authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-control-access-to-api.html "API GW access"), [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/ "AWS X-Ray"), and more.
